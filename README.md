python_samples: 


Execute as follows:

  python3 prog2.py 
  
    - computes a subjects body mass index
    
  
  python3 prog67.py 
  
    - simulates Conway's "Game of life"
  
    - Program asks for an file input (examples given are lifedata and save.txt) of a grid of O's and 1's, 
      with 0's representing no cells or dead cells, and 1's representing live cells. 
      
    - The rules of the game are as follows: (from Wikipedia)
    
        - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
        
        - Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
        
        - Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
        
        - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. 
        
    - program asks for the number of generations you want the cells to grow, and prints the results of all the generations
    
    
    - output will show where the cells are alive based on the previous generations ( * represents live cells ) 
    
    
    -program asks user if they want to save the output of the last generation 
    
  python3 prog4.py 
  
    - Program converts a user inputted string to Morse code 
    
  python3 create_snapshot.py
  
    - Create_snapshot.py --> takes a snapshot of the amazon resource EC2 instance everyday and deletes the snapshot from 8 days ago.
